                         2.process builder
3.apex is also a way if you wanna make a custom flow

1.flow builder = it is used when we dont know the future steps
                 it is recommended between FB and PB

APEX>>>>>
Account a = new Account();//this creats a new record in the account object.
(or)
can add an attribute as well
Account a = new Account(Name = 'saif' Phone = 8857328922);

DML stands for data manupulation language ex inset update delete etc 

//updating the values


contact c = new Contact(FirstName = "ali" , lastName = 'alim');
insert c;
system.debug("old departnemt " + c.Department);
c.Department = 'sales';
update c;

system.debug('new Department' + c.Department);


<<<<COLLECTIONS:
collection is the variable that can store multiple records
they are of three types
1.List
2.Set
3.Map


1.list:Its a collection of ordered records
 //creating a list and aassigning a value to it;
   List<string> ListOfItems = new List<strings{'sa', 'va', }
    system.debug("list of items" + ListOfItems);

size()
add()
get()
set()
clear() are some of the methods used in the lists
we cannot use set or map to interract with the database. List is only use to insert, update or interact eith the database.


<<<2.Set: it is the collection of inordered records. in set we cannot use set[0],set[1] etc
     it contains only unique values..

   method to create set is same as list.


<<<3. Maps; a map is a list of key value pairs, with each pair having a unique key in the map . both keys can be of any data type
   
  creating a map
  Map<String, string> pCodeTopName = new Map< string, string>{
   'one'=> 'tv', 'two'=>'Tablet'}



<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Account a = new Account(Name ='saif' ,lName = 'ali')
 insert a ;
system.debug(a);// only single record have been added to database

<<<>>>>>>>>>
List<Account> acclist = new List<Account>();
Account a1 = new Account(Name ='saif1' ,lName = 'ali1')
Account a2 = new Account(Name ='saif2' ,lName = 'ali2')
Account a3 = new Account(Name ='saif3' ,lName = 'ali3')

acclist.add(a1);
acclist.add(a2):
acclist.add(a3);

insert acclist;

this inserts a list of account in the databse
